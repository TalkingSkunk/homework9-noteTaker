## Description

### What needs are we meeting?
* You are a great thinker,
    * who needs to jot down your inspirations on the fly,
    * So you need a note taker.


### What would be the foreseeable consequences if the needs are unmet?
* You will think of a great saying, and have no way to write down your thoughts before they vanish after the moment.


### What were your goals?
* Create Constructor Class templates for each role title.
* Create HTML card templates for each person.
* Create 3 series of inquirer prompts for the 3 role titles.
* Create a JS engine that processes user's input through Constructor Classes, and modifies the HTML card templates, and then puts all the cards into a finished HTML.
* Output the finished HTML into a separate folder.


### What have you done about it?
* All goals are met.



## Installation

1. All you need is a working computer or phone!



## Features

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
